                        Akroid is a personal project that I started to simulate space battles that expanded to become a full RTS.
                        All the code, story and art are original to this game.
                        I created the ships, stations, planets and environment images and the characters were created by a family member of mine.<br>
                        The first goal of this project is to keep the project as Free and Open Source as possible.
                        The second is to create a new, unique and timeless game to engage players with.

                    <p class="whitetext" style="padding-top: 10px;">
                        In the standard RTS style, the base game mode has multiple factions in the same solar system.<br>
                        Each faction starts off with a main station called the fleet command, 4 mining stations, 4 transports and 1 gas collector.
                        Mining stations slowly mine the asteroid fields close to them and store the metal in their cargo bay.
                        Transport ships take the cargo from the mining station and drop it off at the fleet command.
                        Gas collectors move to the gas clouds at the edge of the solar system to collect gas and bring it back to the fleet command as well. <br><br>
                        The fleet command can use its construction bay to build more transports, gas collectors, mining stations, science ships and combat ships as long as it has enough resources.
                        The construction bay can also upgrade the components on the fleet command, or any ship in its hangar.
                        Science ships research the stars and bring their data back to the fleet command, data can be used to improve the efficiency of weapons, thrusters and shields.
                        Combat ships can be put into fleets to form more effective combat units, they use projectile turrets, laser turrets and missile launchers to fight other factions. <br><br>
                        The game ends when there is only one faction remaining.

                        The campaign game mode starts off with a tutorial and then explains the lore of the civilization. <br>
                        The civilization has just reached the space age and the planet is running out of resources.
                        The player controls a mining station that is tasked with supplying the planet with some much-needed resources.
                        Tension on the planet is building as the resources are becoming scarce. <br>
                        Will you the be able to help expand the space industry in time to prevent war and explore the rest of space?

                        Akroid isn't on any public repository or released on any gaming platform yet. <br>
                        I am currently in the process of re-designing the file structure from Unity's design to have a loosely coupled simulation and UI.
                        After that is complete the code will be more testable, being able to run without the burden of having to create Unity gameobjects.<br>
                        There are three other main areas of improvement after that. The first is to implement multiplayer, which will take some time.
                        The second is to parallelize the simulation to run on multiple threads. The third is to make a save system to save and load games.<br><br>
                        I am planning to release the game for free on Steam and some other distributions as well.
