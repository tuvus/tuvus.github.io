                        Akroid is a personal project that I started to simulate space battles that expanded to become a full RTS.
                        All the code, story and art are original to this game.
                        I created the ships, stations, planets and environment images and the characters were created by a family member of mine.<br>
                        There are two goals of this project. The first goal is to keep the project as Free and Open Source as possible.
                        The second is to create a new, unique and timeless game to engage players with.
