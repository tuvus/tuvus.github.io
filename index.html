                        Akroid is a personal project that I started to simulate space battles that expanded to become a full RTS.
                        All the code, story and art are original to this game.
                        I created the ships, stations, planets and environment images and the characters were created by a family member of mine.<br>
                        There are two goals of this project. The first goal is to keep the project as Free and Open Source as possible.
                        The second is to create a new, unique and timeless game to engage players with.

                        In the standard RTS style, the base game mode has multiple factions in the same solar system.<br>
                        Each faction starts off with a main station called the fleet command, 4 mining stations, 4 transports and 1 gas collector.
                        Mining stations slowly mine the asteroid fields close to them and store the metal in their cargo bay.
                        Transport ships take the cargo from the mining station and drop it off at the fleet command.
                        Gas collectors move to the gas clouds at the edge of the solar system to collect gas and bring it back to the fleet command as well. <br><br>
                        The fleet command can use its construction bay to build more transports, gas collectors, mining stations, science ships and combat ships as long as it has enough resources.
                        The construction bay can also upgrade the components on the fleet command, or any ship in its hangar.
                        Science ships research the stars and bring their data back to the fleet command, data can be used to improve the efficiency ofq weapons, thrusters and shields.
                        Combat ships can be put into fleets to form more effective combat units, they use projectile turrets, laser turrets and missile launchers to fight other factions. <br><br>
                        The game ends when there is only one faction remaining.
